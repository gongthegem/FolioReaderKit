# Development Workflow

## Task Breakdown and Tracking
1. when completed a task, mark it as completed in @task-tracker.mdc
2. when receiving a new request, break it down to minimal actionable points and add to @task-tracker.mdc

## Task Progression
1. Always work on one task at a time from the breakdown
2. Follow the dependency order in the task list - don't implement features that depend on unfinished components
3. Complete core EPUB handling before focus reading mode
4. Implement basic functionality before adding customization options

## Implementation Approach
1. Start with minimal working implementation (MVP)
2. Test each feature independently before integration
3. Refactor and optimize only after basic functionality works
4. Document public APIs as you develop them
5. Regularly check if implementation matches project requirements

## Progress Tracking
1. Mark completed tasks in your project management system
2. Maintain a TODO.md file at project root with current status
3. Use code comments with TODO, FIXME, NOTE for in-code tracking
4. Update README.md with completed features 

**Best practices**
before excuting a code change, follow the following steps:

1. Clean up current code base first
   - check duplicates
   - check syntax errors
   - delete obsolete and redundant code sections or files

2. Make changes for any requirements as minimal as possible
   - check all the current codes, see if can modify first
   - if cannot modity or integrate, then add new file or fodlers
   - TRY BEST DO NOT influence anyother existing working functionalities
